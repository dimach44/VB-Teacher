- How do I install VBTeacher? 

You don't. It just... runs when you run the executable. P.s. You don't have to uninstall it either.

- It's not running. You said, "It just... runs" but... it's not. Why won't VBTeacher run? 

Wow someone's being a real smart alec. Although I may have been a little arrogant about it just running. Touché. It could be you need to update Windows or .net framework. You can consult our forums at http://www.google.com.

- Can I run VBTeacher on a Mac or other OSs? 

No. Yes. Maybe. Visual Basic is a Windows based program and VBTeacher was made using VB. So it can't run on Mac OSX.

- Wait...You said, "Yes" to the above question and then you said "it can't run on Mac OSX"? 

What?! No I didn't...oh wait...yea, I did. To be fair I did say, "No" first but i see what you getting at. Yes you can run VBTeacher on Linux, Mac OSX, or BSD through the use of a program call Wine. https://www.winehq.org/

- Why are is the text on the left turning purple and not red? 

Programmers...smh. At least you’re reading the Help files. It means that you've read that section of VBTeacher. So you know where you left off.
